# inverseFizzBuzz
### Coding challenge instructions:

Inverse Fizz Buzz 

This is a lot more complicated than the fizzbuzz problem, and takes some real thinking to get right. 

The aim of the test is to **discover the shortest sequence of consecutive numbers, which when they  are run through the fizzbuzz algorithm produce the required output**.
 
For example, the shortest sequence that produces `fizz` is `3`.

When looking for the shortest sequence for 

`fizz buzz `

one sequence that produces that output is 

`3, 4, 5 `

However, this isn't the shortest. The shortest sequence is `9, 10`

In our case, we are only interested in the numbers between 1 and 100, so be sure you limit your calculations to that range.


### Instructions:

To setup the project, first run `npm install`.

Then to run the index file containing the simple solution for "fizz buzz", run `npm run start`.

To see the test results, run `npm run test`. Look at the `coverage` directory to find the `index.html` to see the detailed code coverage analysis.
